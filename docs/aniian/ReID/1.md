> The innovations of this paper encompass the following aspects: 1) To reinforce the algorithm’s robustness to human image alignment and better extract the local fine-grained features of the human body, we pioneer the utilization of masked image modeling techniques in unsupervised feature learning for person ReID. This effectively addresses the challenge of acquiring local fine-grained visual features in human images with substantial occlusions and misalignments. 2) We propose a highly efficient, large-scale self-supervised human feature learning method based on the vanilla ViT, referred to as PersonViT. 3) Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on several mainstream person ReID datasets.
